# Lab 1 - Styled web page by given design

## Story

Imagine, you're a frontend developer at MusicBits Inc., a startup from Silicon Valley. Your company creates best-in-class landing pages for artists of all genres. One day you receive the following e-mail from your boss.

```
Hi, my dear employee!

As you may know, we have signed a new contract! And guess who -- your favorite artist!
We've promised them we'll deliver the first demo of landing page by the end of the month. Please prepare some HTMLs and CSSs by that time.

Cheers,
Your lovely boss. <3
```

The next day the designer sends you the design and you start working on the landing page.

## Task

Your task for this lab is:

1. Download the design as PSD file from [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com/free-psd/music-show-web-design-template_17837363.htm);
2. Copy [index.html](index.html) and [style.css](style.css) to your repo;
3. Open `index.html` in your favorite browser;
4. Update `index.html` and `style.css` so that the page looks similar to the design from PSD file.

## Special conditions

You're not allowed to use any third-party styles.

## Grading

Points:

- first screen - `+4` points
- register tickets block - `+3` points
- footer - `+2` points

You can get `+2` bonus points if it's a responsive design (i.e. it looks good on mobile devices).

## Hints

- You can use different photos than ones from design. In this case you should give credits to them.
- At early stages, use placeholders for images.
- It shouldn't necessarily be pixel-perfect - don't spend time on minor details.
